Python Basics

Pre-requisites
	Git & Git bash
	Python
	VS Code or other text editor

Installation
	Verifying installation and finding your python version
	Using the python terminal on the command line
		print()
		quit()

Assignment and evaluation:
Basic variable assignment and manipulation
	variables and values
	hello world
		assign words 
		concatenate variables and strings - accounting for spaces
		concatenate variables and variables
		maths with variables
		mixing data types and exceptions
	evaluating variable values

user input

Python files and running from the command line

Evaluation and iteration (+ identation)
	if and if/else statements

lists 
    mutable
    items added to end of list
    allows duplicates
    copies memory location (object.copy())
dictionaries
    mutable
    unordered - key value pairs
    values can be duplicated, keys cannot
tuples - 
    immutable, ordered, order fixed
    allows multiple data types
    single items still require a comma

while loops
for loops

Error handling - try/except

Functions and method signatures

Class structures and imports (as part of game)

Guesing Game:
Phase 1
	computer 'thinks of a number', store a random integer between 1 - 10
	take user input (guess)
	report if correct

Phase 2
	define what the minimum and maximum number are
	report minimum and maximum numbers to the user on input request
	evaluate user responses:
		is a number?
		is within range?
		is an integer?

Phase 3
	multiple user 'guesses' up to a defined maximum (game loop)

Phase 4 
	hint higher or lower than guess

Phase 5
	move code into methods + error handling
	difficulty levels?

Phase 6
	class structures and importing classes
	constructors
